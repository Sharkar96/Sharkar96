## Hi there 👋

I'm a Software Engineer, here you can find some project I have done for work and university.

### Master projects:
- (2024) MS thesis - Pose Estimation Algorithm design (private repo): Python and C slip detection and odometry algorithm using only relative positioning sensors (Encoders, IMU). Invented Piecewise Autonomous Multi Model (PAMM) using multiple EKF.
- (2024) Flight UAV control sys design (not on GitHub): For the automation course, manually tuned the PID (x, y, z) in nested loop design (position, velocity, acceleration). Designed on Simulink a control system for automatic takeoff, waypoint following and landing.
- (2024) Black Hole Deep QNetwork: Paper implementation for the Reinforcement Learning course. Python + Tensorflow notebook on training a 2D agent to evade obstacles and reach goals using a reward heuristic.
- (2024) Land Rover control (not on GitHub): Laboratory for the Mobile Robotic course. Written python code to move a robot using ROS2 and OpenCV to recognize and stop at a semaphore. 
- (2022) ML Lab Assignmens (not on GitHub): Python notebooks about Linear Regression, Linear Classification, Unsupervised learning, Fully connected Layers, CNNs for image recognition.

### Bachelor projects:
- (2022) BS thesis - Pose estimation Algorithm (not on GitHub): Python code for reverse-estimating camera pose from a known light pattern in a Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV), using OpenCV and ROS.  
- (2022) Algorithms and Data Structures Laboratory (not on GitGub): Python code on three small project on Binary Search Tree (BTS), Red-Black Tree (RBT), connected components, MST and Mergesort across devices. Documented in LaTeX.
- (2022) Bayesian Network Inference: Python code on implementing the results of a paper about Bayesian networks for the AI course.
- (2021) Grocery shopping offloading App (not on GitHub): Project design for the Software engineering course. Started from Functional requirements, build many diagrams using StartUML from class to sequence diagram, documentation and testing of some requirements.
- (2020) Time tracking app: C++14 and Qt5 application for time management developed for the OOP final exam it also feature some Unit Testing with Google test
- (2020) Power Analyzer: C++14 and Qt5 application for easily computing Annual/Monthly/Daily cost of your appliances

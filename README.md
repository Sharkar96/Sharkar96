## Hi there 👋

I'm a Software Engineer, here you can find some project I have done for work and university.

###Bachelor progects:
- (2022) BS thesis - Pose estimation Algorithm (not on GitHub): Python code for reverse-estimating camera pose from a known light pattern in a Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV), using OpenCV and ROS.  
- (2022) Algorithms and Data Structures Laboratory (not on GitGub): Python code on three small project on Binary Search Tree (BTS), Red-Black Tree (RBT), connected components, MST and Mergesort across devices. Documented in LaTeX.
- (2022) Bayesian Network Inference: Python code on implementing the results of a paper about Bayesian networks for the AI course.
- (2021) Grocery shopping offloading App (not on GitHub): Project design for the Software engineering course. Started from Functional requirements, build many diagrams using StartUML from class to sequence diagram, documentation and testing of some requirements.
- (2020) Time tracking app: C++14 and Qt5 application for time management developed for the OOP final exam it also feature some Unit Testing with Google test
- (2020) Power Analyzer: C++14 and Qt5 application for easily computing Annual/Monthly/Daily cost of your appliances

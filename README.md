## Hi there 👋

I'm a Software Engineer, here you can find some project I have done for work and university.

### 🎓 Master's Projects
- 🤖 **(2024) MS Thesis – Pose Estimation Algorithm Design (Private Repo):** Developed a Python and C slip detection and odometry algorithm using **strictly** relative positioning sensors (Encoders, IMU). Invented the **Piecewise Autonomous Multi Model (PAMM)** framework utilizing multiple **Extended Kalman Filters (EKF)**.
- 🚁 **(2024) Flight UAV Control System Design:** Designed a control system for automatic takeoff, waypoint following, and landing for the Automation course. **Manually tuned nested-loop PID controllers** (position, velocity, acceleration) and implemented the full architecture in **Simulink**.
- 🕳️ **(2024) Black Hole Deep Q-Network:** A paper implementation for the Reinforcement Learning course. Developed a Python and **TensorFlow** notebook to train a 2D agent to evade obstacles and reach goals using a **custom reward heuristic**.
- 🚜 **(2024) Land Rover Control:** Developed for the Mobile Robotics Laboratory. Wrote Python code to control a robot using **ROS 2** and used **OpenCV** for computer vision-based semaphore recognition and navigation.
- 🧠 **(2022) ML Lab Assignments:** A collection of Python notebooks covering **Linear Regression, Linear Classification, Unsupervised Learning**, Fully Connected Layers, and **CNNs for image recognition**.

### 🎓 Bachelor's Projects
- ⚓ **(2022) BS Thesis – Pose Estimation Algorithm:** Python implementation for reverse-estimating camera pose from a known light pattern for an **Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV)** using **OpenCV and ROS**.
- 🌳 **(2022) Algorithms and Data Structures Laboratory:** Implemented three core projects focusing on **Binary Search Trees (BST)**, Red-Black Trees (RBT), **connected components, MST, and Mergesort** across distributed devices. Documented thoroughly in **LaTeX**.
- 📊 **(2022) Bayesian Network Inference:** Python implementation of a research paper’s results regarding **Bayesian Network inference** for the AI course.
- 🛒 **(2021) Grocery Shopping Offloading App:** A full-cycle project design for the Software Engineering course. Managed the process from **Functional Requirements** to system architecture, building **UML diagrams (Class, Sequence)**, documentation, and unit testing.
- ⏱️ **(2020) Time Tracking App:** A **C++14 and Qt5** application for time management developed for the OOP final exam. Features automated **Unit Testing using Google Test**.
- 🔌 **(2020) Power Analyzer:** A **C++14 and Qt5** desktop application designed to compute and visualize the **Annual, Monthly, and Daily energy costs** of household appliances.
